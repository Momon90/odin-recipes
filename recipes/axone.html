    <h2>Description</h1>
        <p>Axone, also known as akhuni, is a cherished fermented soybean dish from Nagaland, India, deeply rooted in the culinary traditions of the Sumi Naga tribe. Renowned for its pungent aroma and distinctive umami flavor, it’s a versatile ingredient used as both a condiment and a base in various dishes, including curries, chutneys, and pickles. The preparation involves boiling soybeans until tender, draining them, and fermenting them in bamboo baskets or wrapped in banana leaves near a fire for several days, often followed by gentle pounding to create a semi-coarse paste or cakes. This process imparts a smoky, bitter undertone that elevates dishes like smoked pork curry, vegetable stews, or spicy king chili chutneys, making axone a bold, acquired taste that embodies Nagaland’s rich food culture.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Prepare Axone (Akhuni)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Soak Soybeans</strong>: Rinse 500 grams of soybeans thoroughly and soak them in water for 8-12 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Boil Soybeans</strong>: Drain the soaked soybeans, place them in a large pot, and cover with fresh water. Boil for 2-3 hours until soft but not mushy. Drain and let cool slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferment Soybeans</strong>: Transfer the boiled soybeans to a clean bamboo basket or wrap them tightly in banana leaves. Place near a low heat source (like a fireplace) or in a warm, dark place for 4-7 days to ferment. Check for a strong, pungent smell and sticky texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Process Axone</strong>: Once fermented, lightly pound the soybeans into a coarse paste or form into small cakes. Store in an airtight container for use.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Steps to Cook Axone Pork Curry</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Ingredients</strong>: Measure out 2 tablespoons of axone, chop 500 grams of pork into cubes, and finely chop 1 onion, 1 tomato (if using), 2-3 green chilies or 1-2 king chilies, 1-inch ginger, and 4-5 garlic cloves.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Oil</strong>: In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 tablespoons of mustard oil over medium heat until it smokes lightly. Reduce heat slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics</strong>: Add chopped onion, ginger, and garlic. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until golden and fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Axone</strong>: Stir in 2 tablespoons of axone paste or crumbled cake. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly to release its aroma (use ventilation due to the strong smell).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook Pork</strong>: Add pork cubes and 1-2 teaspoons of turmeric powder. Stir well to coat the meat with the axone mixture. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the pork starts to brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Chilies and Tomato</strong>: Add slit chilies and chopped tomato (if using). Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the tomato softens.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer Curry</strong>: Pour in 1-2 cups of water, depending on desired consistency. Add salt to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pork is tender and the flavors meld.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Consistency</strong>: If the curry is too thick, add a bit more water; if too thin, simmer uncovered for a few more minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish and Serve</strong>: Optionally, garnish with fresh coriander or Naga herbs. Serve hot with steamed rice or sticky rice.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Cook in a well-ventilated area due to axone’s pungent odor. Adjust chili and axone quantities to suit your taste.</p>

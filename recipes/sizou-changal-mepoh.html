    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sizou Changal Mapo, a quintessential Kuki dish from Northeast India, is a soul-warming blend of finely chopped meat—often chicken, pork, or beef—simmered with coarsely ground local rice into a thick, porridge-like consistency. Infused with the subtle heat of green chilies and the earthy aroma of crushed dry yam leaves, this hearty dish is elevated by a pinch of baking soda, which melds the flavors into a cohesive, comforting meal. Cooked slowly to let the rice break down and absorb the meat’s savory juices, it embodies the Kuki culinary ethos of simplicity and bold, natural tastes, perfect for a nourishing family meal served alongside fresh vegetables or a fiery chutney.</p>
